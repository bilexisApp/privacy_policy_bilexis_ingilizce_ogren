# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2026-02-08
Last Updated: 2026-02-08

This Privacy Policy explains the approach of **Bilexis: Learn English** application ("Application") regarding user privacy.

## Quick Summary
- The Application currently **uses local mock data** and **does not send data to any server**.
- In-app progress and preference information (e.g., selected language) is **stored only on your device**.
- There are **no third-party SDKs** in the Application for purposes of **ads**, **analytics**, **crash reporting**, or **tracking**.
- **In the future**, when server integration is planned, this policy will be updated.

## Scope
This policy covers privacy impacts that may arise due to how the Application operates.
If a link in the Application redirects to a website, the relevant website's own privacy policy applies.

## Data We Collect
The Application **does not collect** the following data categories:
- Identity information (name, surname, email, phone, etc.)
- Location data
- Device identifiers (advertising ID, IMEI, etc.)
- People, photos/media, files
- Financial information
- Health/sensitive personal data
- Analytics/telemetry data

### Data Stored Locally on Device
The Application may store some information **only in local storage** to provide basic functionality:
- In-app progress status (e.g., completed lessons, exercise results)
- Application preferences (e.g., selected language)

This information is not transmitted outside the device and cannot be accessed remotely by the developer.

## How We Use Data
Since the Application does not collect personal data, data usage is limited to:
- Maintaining the application experience (preserving progress/preferences)
- Ensuring application features work correctly

## Data Sharing / Transfer
- The Application **does not share** any personal data with third parties.
- The Application **does not send** locally stored progress/preference information to the cloud or developer servers.

## Third-Party Services and SDKs
The Application **does not use** third-party SDKs/services for the following purposes:
- Displaying advertisements
- Analytics
- Crash reporting / error tracking
- User tracking

## Permissions
The Application may use standard permissions required for its operation depending on the platform.
Example: Internet access (in scenarios involving server integration or content loading). The Application does not use these permissions to collect personal data.

## Data Retention Period
- Locally stored progress/preference data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the application.
- Uninstalling the application will also remove the related local data stored on your device.

## Data Security
Since the Application stores data only on your device, security measures largely depend on your device's security settings.
Nevertheless, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

## Children's Privacy
- The Application is **not designed for children under 13 years of age**.
- The Application does not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 13 years of age.

If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us at the address below.

## Your Rights and Options
Since the Application does not collect personal data, there is no data processed by the developer that would be subject to access/correction/transfer requests.

For locally stored device data, your options are:
- You can remove local data by uninstalling the application.
- You can reset the relevant progress/preferences from the application settings (if available).

## International Data Transfer
Since the Application does not collect personal data and does not send data to any server, it does not perform international data transfers.

## Changes to This Policy
This policy may be updated as needed. The current version is published on this page.
If there are significant changes, we aim to inform users in appropriate places.

**When server integration is planned in the future, this privacy policy will be updated to cover related data processing, data retention, and user rights.**
