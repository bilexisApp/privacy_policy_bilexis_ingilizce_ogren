Effective Date: 2026-03-02
Last Updated: 2026-03-02

This Privacy Policy explains the approach of **Bilexis: İngilizce Öğren** application ("Application") regarding user privacy.

## Quick Summary
- The Application allows users to create accounts and **syncs your progress and preferences** to our secure servers.
- We collect basic **identity information** (such as email) for account creation, login, and password resetting.
- Progress and preference information (e.g., selected language, completed lessons) is **stored on our servers** to ensure a seamless experience across devices.
- The Application uses **third-party services** for authentication (Google, Apple) and content delivery (embedded YouTube videos).
- We **do not sell** your personal data to third parties.

## Scope
This policy covers privacy impacts that may arise due to how the Application operates.
If a link or embedded content in the Application redirects to a third-party service (e.g., YouTube), the relevant service's own privacy policy applies.

## Data We Collect
The Application collects the following data categories to provide its core functionality:
- **Identity Information:** Email address and password (if registering directly), or basic profile information (name, email) provided by third-party authentication services (Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In).
- **App Usage & Progress Data:** In-app progress status (e.g., completed lessons, exercise results) and application preferences (e.g., selected language, selected level).
- **Device Information:** Secure tokens used for authentication and session management.

The Application **does not collect**:
- Location data
- Financial information (we do not process payments directly)
- Health/sensitive personal data
- People, photos/media, files

## How We Use Data
The data we collect is used strictly for the following purposes:
- Creating and managing your user account (including authentication and password reset).
- Maintaining and syncing your learning progress and preferences across your devices.
- Ensuring application features work correctly and personalizing your learning experience.
- Communicating with you regarding your account (e.g., password reset emails).

## Data Sharing / Transfer
- The Application **does not sell or share** any personal data with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.
- Your progress and profile data are sent to and securely stored on our cloud servers to provide the Application's core services.

## Third-Party Services and SDKs
The Application uses the following required third-party services:
- **Authentication Providers:** Google Sign-In and Apple Sign-In (for alternative login methods).
- **Content Providers:** YouTube (for embedded educational videos in lessons). When viewing embedded videos, YouTube may collect data according to its own Privacy Policy.

The Application **does not use** third-party SDKs/services for:
- Displaying third-party advertisements
- User tracking across other apps

## Permissions
The Application requires **Internet access** to connect to our servers, fetch learning materials, and sync your progress. The Application does not use permissions to access your external storage, camera, or contacts to collect personal data.

## Data Retention Period
- Your account information, progress, and preferences are retained securely on our servers as long as your account is active.
- If you request to delete your account, your personal data and progress will be permanently removed from our servers in accordance with our retention policies.
- Locally cached data on your device is removed if you uninstall the application or clear the app's data.

## Data Security
We take appropriate security measures to protect your data. Authentication tokens are stored in the device's secure storage. Communications between the Application and our servers are encrypted. However, please note that no system or transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

## Children's Privacy
- The Application is **not designed for children under 13 years of age**.
- We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 13 years of age.

If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us at the address below so we can take steps to delete such information.

## Your Rights and Options
Since the Application stores your account and progress data on our servers, you have the following rights:
- **Access and Correction:** You can view and update your profile information and preferences (such as language and level) within the application.
- **Account Deletion:** You can request the deletion of your account and all associated data by contacting us or using an in-app deletion feature.
